  <!-- Testing Protocol -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="team" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Testing Protocol</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <h3>What Is Our <b>Research Question?</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Can a well designed user interface reduce the time and hassel in taking attendance (for teachers) and participating in class (for students) in a hybrid synchronous environment?</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The overall goal of our design is making it easier to manage attendance relative to the solutions that are in place today.</li>
      <li>By measuring criteria that is later determined in our testing procedure we can clearly assert whether or not this goal is reached.</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>What <b>Methodology</b> Would We Use For Testing?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If we had the capability to perform a user test, we dicided that a surveyt would be one of the best options for two reasons.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Quick and simple - We believe it is the simplest way to measure our design goals because we are able to collect data from people using the app who represent our target end users as a whole.</li>
        <li>COVID-19 - with a survey people can take it on their own time and will not have to interact with others.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Testing Procedure -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="packages" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Testing Procedure</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <h3>What Is Our <b>General Testing Procedure?</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We would plan to send emails to UGA students and teachers. With it, an explination of the prototype, what its goal is, and how to use it. Of course a link to the prototype would be provided in the email as well. If emails do not provide enough responses we could try other digital mediums like groupme, slack, however we can reach students and teachers. It might help to split the prototypes into a teacher model and a student model so we get proper feedback.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Our Plan To Deal With <b>Informed Consent?</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe in the email what the survey is for in paragraph form. As well as, what specific information we will be collecting and how it will be used.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What <b>Data</b> Will We Be Looking For?</h3>
    <p>Here are the questions we will be asking on our survey.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Did you find this new class managment format easy or confusing, why?</li>
      <li>Did you find this app useful for managing a hybrid synchronous environment?</li>
      <li>If you had to estimate, was this a faster or slower way to get class information?</li>
      <li>Would you use the application again?</li>
      <li>Did you find anything frustrating?</li>
      <li>Any bugs or consistency issues?</li>
      <li>What features would you like to see?</li>
      <li>What features did you find unnecessary?</li>
      <li>Where there any barriers that prevented you from enjoying your app experience</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What Type Of <b>Analysis</b> Do We Intend To Perform?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Since we are recording qualitative data as opposed to quantitative, it makes the most sense to use descriptive analysis, the most straightforward form of analysis. We want to set a benchmark to achieve in our collected data. We can see how well our UI works based on how many responses to data collection questions achieve our benchmark. That benchmark will be that a majority of responses to our UI in our survey were positive. This means positive responses to the questions “Did you find this application useful?” and “Would you use the application again?”, and minimal responses to the follow up questions that show negative qualities in our UI.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How Might You Conduct Your Testing Procedure <b>Safely</b> During A Pandemic?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Since it is a survey, we can create a google form or webpage. Then we could just email it to potential users and avoid any physical contact.</li>
      <li>We are also interested in hearing from users directly, so we could potential transform our survey into a focus group meeting over zoom. Allowing use to walk them through the prototype and get direct responses</li>
