     This is team Runtime Terror's term project for the UGA course CSCI 4800/6800 for Spring of 2021. The Team includes Griffin Riekel, Gian Cella, Byron Grogan, Eric Mendez, and Adeeb Khan. 
     Our team was tasked for designing an app themed around hybrid synchronous instruction. Originally our group just wanted to build an application to make it easier to find and post zoom links for online classes, because we have personally found this to be a recent problem. 
     When hybrid synchronous instruction became popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers would each have their own way of sending zoom links to studnets. It was very unorganized and hunting for zoom links just seemed like a waste of time. 
     However, we needed something more to accommodate both the online component class and the in-person component of a hybrid-synchronous environment.
     After some deliberation the team decided to design an application that helps students and teachers manage their classroom presence. 
     For students they can reserve seats for in person instruction or choose online as their preference and join class via the provided zoom link. For teachers it allows them to communicate with their students how many in person seats are available, the location and time of the class, and how to join the online class. 
     The app also allows teacher to see how their students plan to participate in class and in turn makes attendance a little easier.
